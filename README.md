Custom front-end for the, now mostly defunct, [GTD-PHP](http://www.gtd-php.com/) database. I set out to slowly create my own UI for the application, with the following goals:

* much improved usability
  * less clicks/actions required for most common workflows
  * more actions available from the keyboard
* improved performance (the original software was not designed to keep all history of items completed in the past)
* based on a decent, but tiny MVC framework for improved maintainability

I'm updating it slowly with the first milestone to reach the level of functionality as the original program.
